# font-booster-fixer #

FontBoosterFixer is a libary which tries convert font-sizes that were altered by android's font boosting back to their original size.

## Why is this fix needed? ##

There is currently no good css fix that will work in all cases, therefor we created this javascript library which tries to correct all font-sizes.

## What is still todo? ##

* Test on more devices
* Performance optimalizations (maybe using the user-agent to determine if the script has to be run?)
